Asssalamualaikum everyone.
I'm Abu Jafar Saifullah and Today I'll be giving a presentation on 3 useful HTML Tags

<CHANGE>

The topic includes
    1. q Tag
    2. select tag
    2. option tag


<CHANGE>


Let's start with q tag

q in an inline quotation element i.e. it helps in encitinh an enclosed text.
this element is used for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.

-> For long quotations, blockquote is used

For example, I took a scenario based on the characters from the famous TV Series Game of Thrones. And here Jon Snow is supposed to solve a problem. We'll get to the problem in the latter part of the presentation.

So here, Jon fails to solve the problem. And Ygritte says,
You know nothing Jon Snow.

this part is cited by using the q tag.

The remaining two tags that I had was select and option

In a form, we often come across a section where we might need to select an option from a couple of options. This type of problems are solved using select and option.
where select representsa a control that provides a menu of options. And option element is used to define an item contained in a select.

Now back to our Jon Snow problem. So the task that Jon had to do was pretty simple. He had to select a banner for the upcoming rebellion
